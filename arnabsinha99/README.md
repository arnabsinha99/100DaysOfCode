Hi, I am a sophomore pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science at The LNMIIT, Jaipur.

I currently work in the following languages:

* Python for Data Science , ML and AI

I have slight experience in Bootstrap 4 framework also.

These would be my aim for the next 100 days:-

* I intend to strengthen my grasp over the languages I already am familiar with and also look forward to learn JavaScript, JQuery, Django Framework and Tensorflow Framework.

* I would also like to work further in Python for Data Science purposes and have major progress in the construction of my own website.
